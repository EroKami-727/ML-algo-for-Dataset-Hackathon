# ML-algo-for-Dataset-Hackathon
Machine learning algorithm I had (incompletely) made for the dataset hackathon in VIT Chennai
#How to use it?
copy paste the code in VSCode and AFTER installing all the imported libraries make a local folder and save the csv file in it, replace that folder directory in the code.
u should be able to run it now. It's about 12 Epochs but runs fairly quick.

#PURPOSE
Made for the dataset hackathon to analyse and sort network logs to help an employee find issues faster and solve it. Main libraries used would be Tensorflow,sklearn,SMOTE,shap,seaborn,matplotlib,numpy and pandas. The code is made mainly on Python but the program will run locally and give output locally (Graphs and maybe text outputs)

Setting the directories for the file will be a huge hassle, so sorry for that but that is the part of the code I left for my future self before changing to a different algorithm entirely.
